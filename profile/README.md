balenaBlocks are a type of "app enablement" for fleets.
They are ready to go docker images, that you can drop into your project to provide some functionality you need.
For example, if you have a web app and you wish to display it on a connected display, you can add the [browser block](https://github.com/balenablocks/browser) to your docker compose and hey presto!

You can find a more detailed explanation of blocks on [our blog](https://www.balena.io/blog/introducing-balenablocks-jumpstart-your-iot-app-development/)!

Check out [blocks on balenaHub](https://hub.balena.io/blocks) to browse the complete catalog of blocks from balena and the community.
